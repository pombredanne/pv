# pv

minimal wsgi framework.

```
pip install pv
```

This is more or less a blatant rip off of one of the earliest releases of [tornado](https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado), if not the earliest. I rewrote some parts of `web` and `wsgi` modules to my pleasure and for app engine compatibility.

This is from 2010 or something, so don't expect much, I am not thinking of maintaining this any further. Check out [webapp2](https://webapp-improved.appspot.com), [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) or [tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org) herself. Still most of the wsgi apis are pretty much same, I'd suggest reverse engineering yours too.

My [personal site](http://onurgunduz.com) is built on pv, you can see [its source](http://github.com/tetsuo/onurgunduz.com) for example usage.
